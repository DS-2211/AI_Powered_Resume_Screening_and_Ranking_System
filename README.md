--> Key Features:

      Resume Processing Automation: Extracts text from PDF resumes using pdfplumber.
      Smart Ranking: Ranks candidates utilizing TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
      Normalizing Similarity Score: Prevents unfair ranking by scaling similarity scores between 0 and 1 for uniformity.
      Interactive Dashboard: Created with Streamlit to input job descriptions and upload resumes.
      Downloadable Reports: Generates ranked candidates as a CSV report for deeper analysis.
     
--> Technology Stack:

      Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy
      TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity for AI-powered ranking
     
--> Expected Outcomes:

      Improved resume screening at higher speeds, eliminating manual effort.
      Increased accuracy of candidate ranking for enhanced hiring decisions.
      Reduced bias for objective evaluation.

--> Future Enhancements:
     
      Use of deep learning models (BERT, GPT) to improve semantic understanding.
      Real-time job market trend analysis to enhance ranking.
